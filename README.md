# molecule_binding_prediction
The project utilises ML models and ensembles to predict molecular binding, leveraging fingerprints and protein features. It evaluates model performance, integrates calibration for refined predictions, and aims to optimise accuracy in chemical compound interactions. Tools: DuckDB, RDKit, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Ensemble Learning,Calibration
