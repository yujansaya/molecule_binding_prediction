Each entry includes SMILES representations of molecule structures and binary labels for binding to each protein target. The competition data, provided by Leash Biosciences, consists of approximately **98M** training examples per protein, **200K** validation examples per protein, and **360K** test molecules per protein. *Keep in mind that dataset is very imbalanced:  roughly 0.5% of examples are classified as binders*<br><br>\n\n<center><h2>So, what is SMILES?</h2><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7cced3_08c22a1ad56a4d2b81c46c8d71ebc34b~mv2.gif\" ></center><br>\n\nSMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a notation system for representing chemical structures in a computer-readable format. Developed with funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it offers a flexible and easily learned approach to representing molecules. SMILES notation follows five basic syntax rules:\n\n* Atoms and Bonds: Atoms are represented by their atomic symbols, with lowercase letters indicating aromatic atoms. Bonds are denoted by symbols (- for single, = for double, # for triple, * for aromatic, and . for disconnected structures).\n* Simple Chains: Chains of atoms are represented by combining atomic symbols and bond symbols. Hydrogen atoms are suppressed unless explicitly stated.\n* Branches: Branches from chains are enclosed in parentheses and placed directly after the atom to which they are connected.\n* Rings: Ring structures are identified by using numbers to denote the opening and closing ring atoms. Different numbers are used for each ring, and bond symbols may precede the ring closure number.\n* Charged Atoms: Charges on atoms are indicated by placing the atom symbol within brackets, enclosing the charge.<br>\n\n\n<center><h2>What are the targets?</h2></center><br>\n\nThe dataset includes three protein targets:\n<h3>EPHX2 (sEH):</h3><center><img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26836510/figure/fig1/AS:394310370512898@1471022326590/Pathways-of-EETs-synthesis-metabolism-and-action.png\" ></center><br>\n* This target refers to epoxide hydrolase 2, encoded by the EPHX2 genetic locus. Its protein product, commonly known as soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), is an enzyme that catalyzes certain chemical reactions and hydrolyzes phosphate groups. It is a potential drug target for conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. The dataset includes screening data obtained from Leash Biosciences, along with structural information for model evaluation.\n<h3>BRD4:</h3><center><img src=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1043661823001238-ga1.jpg\" ></center><br>\n* Bromodomain 4 is encoded by the BRD4 locus. Its protein product, also named BRD4, plays a role in gene transcription regulation by binding to histones in the nucleus. This protein is implicated in cancer progression, and inhibiting its activity has been explored as a therapeutic strategy. The dataset includes screening data from Leash Biosciences and structural information for model evaluation.\n<h3>ALB (HSA):</h3><center><img src=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0162013419301734-gr4.jpg\" ></center><br>\n* Serum albumin, encoded by the ALB locus, is the most abundant protein in blood. It regulates osmotic pressure and transports various molecules, including drugs, hormones, and fatty acids. Predicting the binding of small molecules to albumin is crucial for drug development, as it impacts drug distribution and effectiveness. The dataset includes screening data from Leash Biosciences and structural information for model evaluation.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>Now let's get the things done! :D</h3> <br>\n\nWe shall start with the installation of necessary tools. <br><br>\n**DuckDB is an open-source, in-memory database system optimized for fast analytical querying and low memory usage.
